# Object-Based-Key-Frame-Extraction-in-Videos

This is a Flask-powered web application designed for intelligent video analysis. Users can upload a video to automatically generate a summarized version and extract keyframes. The system uses YOLOv5 for object detection, saliency scoring for visual importance, and histogram-based analysis for detecting scene transitions â€” all seamlessly integrated using OpenCV.
